⚡ Typing Speed Tester Project
📌 Description

The Typing Speed Tester is a web-based project that measures a user’s typing speed and accuracy in real time. It provides an engaging way for users to practice typing and improve their skills.

The project has two main pages:

Index Page (Test Page)

Displays a random sentence (quote) for the user to type.

Starts a timer automatically when the user begins typing.

Shows live stats like characters typed and elapsed time.

On submission, the test results are stored and the user is redirected to the results page.

Result Page

Displays the time taken, words per minute (WPM), and accuracy percentage.

Offers a “Try Again” button to restart the test.

The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only — no external frameworks — making it lightweight, responsive, and easy to deploy.
